# Website POS Bridge Module

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **Website POS Bridge Module** is a custom Odoo Community Edition extension designed to bridge the gap between the **Website (E-Commerce)** and the **Point of Sale (POS)** apps.  

It allows seamless order management from your website store directly into the POS system, enabling kitchen display integration, real-time order syncing, and a unified checkout flow.

This module was created to simplify workflows for restaurants, cafÃ©s, and businesses that require both **online ordering** (via website) and **in-store POS management**.
